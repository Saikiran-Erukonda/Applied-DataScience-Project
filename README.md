## 📌 **Table of Contents**  
1. [Project Overview](#-project-overview)

In this project, I developed a complete end-to-end data science solution to predict the success or failure of SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landings. The goal was to enable cost-efficient forecasting for rocket launches, which can support competitive bidding decisions in the aerospace industry.
The workflow included:
- Data Acquisition: Collected launch data via SpaceX’s API and enriched it with mission details through Wikipedia web scraping.
- Data Wrangling: Performed thorough data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.
- SQL Integration: Queried and managed structured launch data using SQL for effective exploration and analysis.
- Data Visualization:
   - Basic and advanced plots using matplotlib and seaborn for EDA.
   - Folium maps to visualize launch site locations and geospatial trends.
   - An interactive dashboard built with Plotly and Dash for real-time data inspection and user-driven insights.
- Predictive Modeling:
  - Applied multiple machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, SVM, and KNN.
  - Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and compared test accuracies to identify the best-performing model.
  - Final model used to predict first-stage landing success based on input launch configurations
